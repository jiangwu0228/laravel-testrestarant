                <p>On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would
                    have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word
                    "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country. A small
                    river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a
                    paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>
